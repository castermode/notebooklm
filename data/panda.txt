---------------1------------Po's dream---------------
　　
　　legend tells of a legendary warrior whose kung fu skill were a stuff of legend . he traveled the land in search of worthy foes
　　I see you like to chew , maybe you should chew on my fist
　　the warrior said nothing for his mouth was full . then he swallowed , and then he spoke : enough talk let's fight . he was so deadly in fact that his enemies would go blind from over-exposure to pure awesomeness!
　　my eyes ...
　　he's too awesome
　　and attractive ...
　　how can we repay you
　　there's no charge for awesomeness , or attrativeness . it mattered not how many foes he faced, they were no match for his foe-desity(实在找不出这个词是啥）. never before had a panda been so feared , and so loved ， even the most herotic heroes in all of the china - the furious five ， bowed in respect of this great master
　　We shall hang out
　　agreed ！
　　yeh ...
　　But hanging out would have to wait , coz when you are facing a ten thousand demons of demon mountain , there's only one thing that it matters , and that's ..
　　PO
　　get up
　　you 'll be late for work
　　what ? ...
　　
　　
　　
　　---------------2------------Po's home---------------

　　oh ... happy day.. my son finally having the noodle dream you don't know how long I 've been waiting for this moment, this is a sign ,po
　　ahh ..a sign of what?
　　you are almost ready to be entrust with the secret ingredient of my secret ingredient soup and then you’ll fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant . just as I took it over from my father, who took it over from his father who won it from a friend in a game of Majiang.
　　dad dad dad, it was just a dream
　　no , it was THE dream
　　We are noodle folk, broth runs though our veins
　　but dad , didn't you ever , I don't know ,wanna do something else ? something besides noodles
